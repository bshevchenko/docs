# Fulcrum Introduction

The Fulcrum portal \([https://fulcrum.trade](https://fulcrum.trade)\) is a front-end web interface that is the first and only completely trustless platform for margin; it does not use centralized price feeds or centrally administered margin calls. It is permissionless and rent free. There are no fees and no accounts to setup. Fulcrum is built on the bZx base protocol and extends the protocol by allowing both loans and margin positions to be tokenized. Tokenized loans, called iTokens, are for lending and earn interest. Tokenized positions, called pTokens, are for gaining long or short market exposure to an asset and let the user trade with borrowed funds and with leverage. Both iTokens and pTokens are ERC20-compliant and provide access to the view functions symbol, name, decimals, totalSupply, balanceOf, and allowance, as well as the non-payable functions transfer, transferFrom, approve, increaseApproval, and decreaseApproval. Collectively, we'll refer to both iTokens and pTokens as "Fulcrum tokens".
